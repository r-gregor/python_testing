    # file manipulation chtsht
fj = open('filename.txt', 'rt')

fj.read()               --> reads entire file as string and leaves pointer at "the end"" of fj!
fj.read().split()       --> reads entire file into a list of all the words
fj.read(N)              --> reads file from current pointer location to location "N" (bytes = chars)

fj.seek(0)              --> go to the beginning of fj
fj.tell()               --> show the pointer location (bytes = chars)

fj.readline()           --> reads a "single" line as string and sets pointer to the beginning of next line
fj.readline().split()   --> reads a "single" line and "splits" it into a list of words

fj.readlines()          --> reads entire file into a list of all the complete lines
fj.read().split('\n')   --> same as fj.readlines() exept without "\n" (adds adiitional '' at the end) [***1]


    !!! DO NOT FORGET !!!
fj.close()

    or:
with open('filename.txt', 'rt') as fj:
    ...
    (all must be under indented block, as fj is automatically closed when block ends)
    ...

    # print all but the last '' line:

for i in range(len(BL2) - 1): print(BL2[i])
