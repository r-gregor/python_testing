2
00:00:51,530 --> 00:00:52,860
Happy birthday to me!

3
00:00:52,890 --> 00:00:54,160
Happy birthday!

4
00:01:02,690 --> 00:01:04,240
- Oh, my God!
- Anybody want this?

5
00:01:10,890 --> 00:01:13,560
That's what happens when
you do a mercy invite.

6
00:01:13,690 --> 00:01:16,040
I believed you wanted
to invite everyone.

7
00:01:16,210 --> 00:01:19,360
Dad, I can't invite everyone in my
art class except for one person

8
00:01:19,450 --> 00:01:21,280
without social
networking evidence

9
00:01:21,370 --> 00:01:23,490
inflicting more pain on that
person than was intended.

10
00:01:23,570 --> 00:01:24,790
And I'm not a monster.

11
00:01:24,890 --> 00:01:26,880
I'm proud of you.
I think.

12
00:01:27,650 --> 00:01:30,110
She gets detention a lot
and she yells

13
00:01:30,210 --> 00:01:32,080
at teachers sometimes.

14
00:01:32,250 --> 00:01:34,160
There was that rumor
that went around

15
00:01:34,250 --> 00:01:36,080
that she just kept
running away from home.

16
00:01:36,170 --> 00:01:37,170
Um, maybe she can Uber.

17
00:01:37,250 --> 00:01:38,900
I seriously believe
that we can go home now.

18
00:01:38,930 --> 00:01:41,520
Um, did I mistakenly convey
this was a democracy?

19
00:01:41,610 --> 00:01:44,560
We are not going
till she gets picked up.

20
00:01:47,170 --> 00:01:50,240
Uh, the car broke down.

21
00:01:50,330 --> 00:01:51,410
I'm just gonna take the bus.

22
00:01:51,450 --> 00:01:53,280
You're not taking a bus.
I'll drive you home.

23
00:01:53,370 --> 00:01:56,040
Claire has almost saved her half
of the money she needs for a car.

24
00:01:56,130 --> 00:01:57,130
Isn't that right?

25
00:01:57,570 --> 00:02:01,560
This'll be one of the few times left
I can drive you guys around. Huh?

26
00:02:02,530 --> 00:02:04,200
Uh, I...

27
00:02:04,290 --> 00:02:06,280
You won't be able to
hear my dad tell jokes

28
00:02:06,370 --> 00:02:08,000
that only he thinks are funny

29
00:02:08,090 --> 00:02:10,800
for an entire car ride
unless you come.

30
00:02:10,930 --> 00:02:12,840
You don't really
wanna miss that.

31
00:02:19,850 --> 00:02:21,850
Wow! I got more gifts
than I thought I did.

32
00:02:23,650 --> 00:02:24,850
Can I put this in here?

33
00:02:24,930 --> 00:02:27,490
Yeah, I'll get it.
Thank you, Marcia.

34
00:02:27,610 --> 00:02:28,850
Maybe he just is into...

35
00:02:30,050 --> 00:02:32,760
Maybe he's just content
where he is.

36
00:02:40,810 --> 00:02:43,440
Hey. Can I help you?

37
00:02:45,690 --> 00:02:46,720
What?

38
00:02:46,810 --> 00:02:48,680
This is the one.
He's really funny.

39
00:02:48,810 --> 00:02:51,270
He does these weekly videos.

40
00:02:53,450 --> 00:02:56,800
See? It's so random.
That is so weird.

41
00:02:59,330 --> 00:03:00,810
Yeah, you have a crush on him.

42
00:03:00,850 --> 00:03:02,060
- I don't get it.
- Pause it.

43
00:03:02,090 --> 00:03:03,340
Yeah, go back.
Why don't you get it?

44
00:03:03,370 --> 00:03:05,480
I just don't get it.
He's blond and he's cute.

45
00:03:05,610 --> 00:03:07,600
No, his eyebrows
are just like...

46
00:03:07,690 --> 00:03:08,960
Shut up. His eyebrows?

47
00:03:09,130 --> 00:03:10,500
That's the one thing
you couldn't get?

48
00:03:10,530 --> 00:03:11,530
Yeah.

49
00:03:18,010 --> 00:03:19,440
Oh, my God.

50
00:03:21,570 --> 00:03:23,950
Oh. You see
what he does, though?

51
00:03:24,490 --> 00:03:26,280
How does he even do that?

52
00:03:26,370 --> 00:03:27,820
That's the whole
point why I'm showing you.

53
00:03:27,850 --> 00:03:29,160
Genius!

54
00:03:30,290 --> 00:03:31,680
So bad.

55
00:03:43,010 --> 00:03:44,010
Hey!

56
00:03:45,010 --> 00:03:47,390
Pardon me, sir. I think
you have the wrong car.

57
00:06:29,730 --> 00:06:31,560
We woke up in here.

58
00:06:39,890 --> 00:06:41,680
What the hell is going on?

59
00:06:42,410 --> 00:06:44,000
What are we doing here?

60
00:06:44,170 --> 00:06:45,880
What happened to my dad?

61
00:06:46,210 --> 00:06:47,520
He's out there.

62
00:06:50,410 --> 00:06:52,560
Do you know what
happened to my dad?

63
00:07:46,450 --> 00:07:48,440
I choose you first.

64
00:07:55,050 --> 00:07:56,960
It's only gonna be a minute.

65
00:08:02,610 --> 00:08:05,280
Pee on yourself.

66
00:08:07,570 --> 00:08:08,570
No!

67
00:08:17,770 --> 00:08:18,880
No.

68
00:08:19,450 --> 00:08:20,560
No!

69
00:08:22,290 --> 00:08:23,480
No!

70
00:08:23,890 --> 00:08:24,890
No!

71
00:08:25,650 --> 00:08:27,800
Open the door!

72
00:08:43,290 --> 00:08:45,120
Hey, are you okay?

73
00:08:47,490 --> 00:08:49,120
He wanted me to dance for him.

74
00:08:56,930 --> 00:08:58,760
The outside door is locked.

75
00:09:02,610 --> 00:09:04,160
Everything's okay.

76
00:09:06,330 --> 00:09:07,800
We're okay.

77
00:09:09,770 --> 00:09:10,960
We're okay.

78
00:09:18,810 --> 00:09:21,160
I hear the tiniest little splash

79
00:09:21,330 --> 00:09:22,760
and here it comes.

80
00:09:22,850 --> 00:09:25,600
A freak of nature, like this.

81
00:09:25,690 --> 00:09:27,680
So, he comes across the stream

82
00:09:27,810 --> 00:09:29,520
and he's so tall

83
00:09:29,610 --> 00:09:32,440
that the water doesn't even
get to his belly.

84
00:09:32,610 --> 00:09:34,520
Then he stops.

85
00:09:34,690 --> 00:09:37,600
And my heart's
coming out of my chest.

86
00:09:38,530 --> 00:09:40,440
You got buck fever.

87
00:09:40,530 --> 00:09:42,800
Uncle John's got buck fever.

88
00:09:43,570 --> 00:09:45,360
That's not true, Casey.
Your daddy's a liar.

89
00:09:45,450 --> 00:09:46,560
How big was the rack?

90
00:09:46,730 --> 00:09:47,730
It was huge.

91
00:09:48,210 --> 00:09:49,860
Where are you supposed to
look when you shoot, Casey?

92
00:09:49,890 --> 00:09:50,950
At the body.

93
00:09:51,050 --> 00:09:52,380
Then why was he
looking at the rack?

94
00:09:52,410 --> 00:09:54,520
'Cause he had buck fever.

95
00:09:55,810 --> 00:09:57,320
She'll say anything you say.

96
00:09:57,490 --> 00:09:58,920
You gonna do that
when you get your

97
00:09:59,010 --> 00:10:00,680
mentored hunting license
in three years?

98
00:10:01,050 --> 00:10:02,400
No, sir.

99
00:10:02,570 --> 00:10:05,080
Make sure you put your
gloves on after you finish.

100
00:10:05,250 --> 00:10:07,520
Your feet and your hands
get cold first out there.

101
00:10:36,130 --> 00:10:37,350
Three students abducted.

102
00:10:37,450 --> 00:10:38,920
The father of
one of the students

103
00:10:39,010 --> 00:10:40,440
woke up dazed
in King of Prussia,

104
00:10:40,530 --> 00:10:41,670
reportedly drugged.

105
00:10:41,770 --> 00:10:43,920
He found the kids
and the car missing.

106
00:10:44,330 --> 00:10:46,000
Neighbors are in disbelief.

107
00:10:46,130 --> 00:10:47,440
A normally quiet community

108
00:10:47,490 --> 00:10:49,600
is reeling after this abduction.

109
00:10:51,370 --> 00:10:54,360
If you have any information concerning
the whereabouts of these girls,

110
00:10:54,450 --> 00:10:56,960
you are urged to
contact the police.

111
00:11:13,770 --> 00:11:16,150
It doesn't matter
if you open that door, Claire.

112
00:11:16,250 --> 00:11:18,400
There's a second locked door.

113
00:11:19,450 --> 00:11:21,560
He's gonna come in
here again, any second,

114
00:11:21,650 --> 00:11:24,280
and we're not letting him
take one of us out again.

115
00:11:25,890 --> 00:11:29,320
We just cried and screamed
and we didn't hurt him

116
00:11:29,410 --> 00:11:32,400
because we were afraid
to get him upset.

117
00:11:32,490 --> 00:11:34,920
God, that's victim shit.
Jesus!

118
00:11:35,410 --> 00:11:37,480
We should fight him.

119
00:11:37,570 --> 00:11:39,920
We should drop
a crazy-ass bomb on him.

120
00:11:40,570 --> 00:11:41,920
I saw him carry one of you

121
00:11:42,010 --> 00:11:44,080
and lay you on the bed
like you weighed nothing.

122
00:11:45,450 --> 00:11:47,680
One punch from him
would knock one of us out.

123
00:11:48,770 --> 00:11:52,000
I took six months
of Kenpo karate class.

124
00:11:52,170 --> 00:11:54,920
And you distract
the assailant with pain.

125
00:11:55,090 --> 00:11:57,470
Everything is so easy
for you guys.

126
00:11:58,290 --> 00:12:00,800
You do one thing, you can
predict the next thing.

127
00:12:03,330 --> 00:12:05,760
It's not the way it's gonna
be in this situation.

128
00:12:05,850 --> 00:12:07,480
We're not getting out of here.

129
00:12:07,650 --> 00:12:10,760
You're saying that you're not gonna
fight with everything in you?

130
00:12:11,850 --> 00:12:14,200
You know the only chance...

131
00:12:14,370 --> 00:12:18,640
The only chance we have is if all
three of us go crazy on this guy.

132
00:12:20,570 --> 00:12:22,600
We have to hurry.

133
00:12:26,090 --> 00:12:28,160
We need you, Casey.

134
00:12:29,050 --> 00:12:31,760
Claire's smart.
Let's listen to her.

135
00:12:32,930 --> 00:12:35,880
I'll do it if
you're gonna do it, too.

136
00:12:38,450 --> 00:12:39,450
We can win.

137
00:12:39,610 --> 00:12:40,750
He'll hurt us.

138
00:12:42,050 --> 00:12:44,510
No. Shut up.

139
00:12:45,490 --> 00:12:47,360
Both of you.

140
00:12:47,530 --> 00:12:51,360
You're gonna pick your miserable
self up and help us get out of here.

141
00:12:53,410 --> 00:12:54,630
Blow me.

142
00:12:55,570 --> 00:12:59,040
And your six months of karate at the
King of Prussia Mall can blow me, too.

143
00:12:59,210 --> 00:13:01,400
No! No, no, you can't
do this today!

144
00:13:01,490 --> 00:13:03,120
You can't do this right now.

145
00:13:03,210 --> 00:13:05,040
Why do you do this?
Why do you act like this?

146
00:13:05,130 --> 00:13:06,730
Why do you act like
you're not one of us?

147
00:13:12,850 --> 00:13:14,840
When you're aiming, Casey,

148
00:13:15,730 --> 00:13:17,680
always keep both eyes open.

149
00:13:18,170 --> 00:13:19,600
Cover your target
with the barrel

150
00:13:19,690 --> 00:13:22,920
then move with it
to get its pace.

151
00:13:23,770 --> 00:13:26,360
I'm warning you, it's gonna be
frustrating the first times.

152
00:13:26,530 --> 00:13:29,200
You're gonna shoot
under it or behind it.

153
00:13:29,290 --> 00:13:31,040
You'll learn to stay with it.

154
00:13:32,490 --> 00:13:34,280
Females are smarter
than the males.

155
00:13:34,370 --> 00:13:36,040
But you know that,
it's like humans.

156
00:13:37,970 --> 00:13:40,120
Females use their nose
to stay alive.

157
00:13:40,210 --> 00:13:41,680
They make sure they have cover.

158
00:13:42,570 --> 00:13:45,760
They always remember they're
trying to stay alive.

159
00:13:45,930 --> 00:13:48,390
Bucks go off by themselves.

160
00:13:48,570 --> 00:13:51,240
Bucks get dumb
during mating season.

161
00:13:51,690 --> 00:13:53,840
Boys make too much noise.

162
00:13:54,170 --> 00:13:56,320
Yes, they do.

163
00:13:56,410 --> 00:13:58,280
I'm better than a boy, right?

164
00:13:59,810 --> 00:14:01,120
Yes, you are.

165
00:14:01,210 --> 00:14:02,400
Hey

166
00:14:08,610 --> 00:14:11,400
I'll let you know when I hear
something that makes sense.

167
00:14:14,970 --> 00:14:17,240
We don't even know
what this is yet.

168
00:14:23,530 --> 00:14:25,910
Hey! I was inspired.

169
00:14:30,250 --> 00:14:31,760
No, no, no, that one.

170
00:14:32,250 --> 00:14:34,600
That one, before the pink
frock coat with the thorns.

171
00:14:34,690 --> 00:14:37,040
That's supposed to be
like a tailored jacket,

172
00:14:37,210 --> 00:14:39,960
but I'm gonna hand-print it
with newspaper headlines.

173
00:14:43,010 --> 00:14:46,200
I'm a simple blouse and
skirt person, but these...

174
00:14:48,170 --> 00:14:51,320
These are very artistic, Barry.

175
00:14:51,490 --> 00:14:55,880
Just the kind of thing Hamptons
ladies would spend $15,000 on

176
00:14:56,090 --> 00:14:57,960
to wear once at a charity ball.

177
00:14:58,170 --> 00:14:59,840
Shut up!

178
00:15:00,050 --> 00:15:02,200
You know, I can't stay too long.

179
00:15:02,370 --> 00:15:04,040
This is just a visit.

180
00:15:04,210 --> 00:15:06,240
Well, tell me what's going on.

181
00:15:08,090 --> 00:15:09,800
What, you mean the email?

182
00:15:09,890 --> 00:15:11,080
No, just the usual things.

183
00:15:11,210 --> 00:15:12,500
Just feelings of
being overwhelmed.

184
00:15:12,530 --> 00:15:16,600
The terseness of your email made it
sound specific and time-related.

185
00:15:17,210 --> 00:15:18,920
Are you looking for something?

186
00:15:19,090 --> 00:15:20,400
No.
No?

187
00:15:20,610 --> 00:15:22,560
I'm just admiring.
I'm better now.

188
00:15:22,690 --> 00:15:23,720
How's work?

189
00:15:23,890 --> 00:15:24,950
It's great.

190
00:15:25,050 --> 00:15:26,760
When I last spoke to them,

191
00:15:26,930 --> 00:15:29,600
they believed you were
a model employee.

192
00:15:29,770 --> 00:15:33,080
They found you meticulous
and conscientious.

193
00:15:33,610 --> 00:15:35,360
You know this, right?
I do.

194
00:15:35,450 --> 00:15:37,200
You've managed there
for 10 years.

195
00:15:37,290 --> 00:15:38,920
You're functioning
very well, Barry.

196
00:15:40,730 --> 00:15:43,560
And it's a rare and wonderful
place for you to work.

197
00:15:43,730 --> 00:15:44,950
Yes, it is.

198
00:15:45,250 --> 00:15:48,280
You know, of all my other
clients with your disorder,

199
00:15:48,370 --> 00:15:50,960
you've been the most
consistent at your job.

200
00:15:52,770 --> 00:15:54,760
Did something happen, Barry?

201
00:15:55,770 --> 00:15:57,240
How old are you?

202
00:15:59,090 --> 00:16:01,240
Just... The Internet is
inconsistent on this point.

203
00:16:01,410 --> 00:16:03,400
Why is that on your mind?

204
00:16:03,610 --> 00:16:07,080
Who's gonna look after us
when you retire or pass on?

205
00:16:07,250 --> 00:16:09,680
You know, we're gonna have to
take care of ourselves

206
00:16:09,770 --> 00:16:11,800
and nobody even believes
that we exist.

207
00:16:11,970 --> 00:16:14,560
If ever something
were to happen to me,

208
00:16:14,650 --> 00:16:17,920
I've made arrangements with a colleague
from Baltimore to take over.

209
00:16:19,090 --> 00:16:20,150
Hmm.

210
00:16:20,250 --> 00:16:21,560
Hey, do you, uh...

211
00:16:22,130 --> 00:16:23,440
You live alone?

212
00:16:23,610 --> 00:16:24,880
You know this.

213
00:16:25,090 --> 00:16:26,640
I'm sorry,
I just meant how long?

214
00:16:26,810 --> 00:16:28,120
Always.

215
00:16:30,450 --> 00:16:32,600
That must be so lonely.

216
00:16:39,290 --> 00:16:41,440
Uh, you know what?

217
00:16:42,250 --> 00:16:45,520
I'm doing much better.
I shouldn't have emailed you. I'm just...

218
00:16:45,610 --> 00:16:47,600
Look at me.
I'm too impulsive.

219
00:16:51,130 --> 00:16:52,270
By the way,

220
00:16:52,370 --> 00:16:54,160
is anybody listening?

221
00:16:54,370 --> 00:16:56,120
Does anybody care about us?

222
00:16:56,330 --> 00:16:57,330
Yes.

223
00:16:57,450 --> 00:17:00,280
The University of Paris has asked
me to do a lecture, in fact.

224
00:17:00,450 --> 00:17:03,720
I'm going to be doing it
via Skype from right here.

225
00:17:03,810 --> 00:17:06,480
People are believing more.

226
00:17:08,490 --> 00:17:10,010
Let's meet at
our usual time next week.

227
00:17:10,170 --> 00:17:12,440
I would rather
you didn't leave, Barry.

228
00:17:14,170 --> 00:17:16,320
Did something happen?

229
00:17:16,490 --> 00:17:17,800
Don't worry.

230
00:17:17,890 --> 00:17:18,950
This was just a visit.

231
00:17:19,050 --> 00:17:20,450
I'm doing much better,
I actually...

232
00:17:20,490 --> 00:17:22,440
Don't you want
your sketches, Barry?

233
00:17:23,210 --> 00:17:25,510
You're usually very
protective of them.

234
00:17:27,210 --> 00:17:28,210
Yeah.

235
00:17:28,690 --> 00:17:29,690
Thanks.

236
00:17:32,810 --> 00:17:35,840
I'll see you next week
at our usual time.

237
00:17:36,970 --> 00:17:39,200
Thanks for fighting
for us, Dr. Fletcher.

238
00:17:51,930 --> 00:17:53,040
Thanks, Dr. Fletcher.

239
00:17:53,170 --> 00:17:54,600
Welcome.

240
00:17:54,690 --> 00:17:55,860
I just think I'm gonna blow it.

241
00:17:55,890 --> 00:17:57,920
No, you'll be great.
I'll see you next week.

242
00:17:58,050 --> 00:17:59,190
Okay, thank you.

243
00:18:05,210 --> 00:18:07,880
...DJ's exclusive million dollar

244
00:18:08,010 --> 00:18:09,920
Holiday Bucks Bonanza.

245
00:18:10,730 --> 00:18:13,400
I don't know how you work
with those people.

246
00:18:14,410 --> 00:18:15,600
What people?

247
00:18:15,730 --> 00:18:16,760
Your patients.

248
00:18:17,450 --> 00:18:22,240
You can't use your thumbs
to spin the wheel, dumbasses.

249
00:18:22,410 --> 00:18:24,710
They always use their thumbs.
Oh.

250
00:18:27,410 --> 00:18:31,920
Well, we look at people who've been
shattered and different as less than.

251
00:18:33,090 --> 00:18:34,360
What if

252
00:18:35,250 --> 00:18:37,360
they're more than us?

253
00:18:38,050 --> 00:18:39,080
What?

254
00:18:42,490 --> 00:18:44,760
Do you believe them?
Your patients.

255
00:18:45,770 --> 00:18:47,400
Just between you and me.

256
00:18:47,570 --> 00:18:49,040
Yes, I do.
Hmm.

257
00:18:50,010 --> 00:18:51,880
Flick it! Flick it!

258
00:18:52,770 --> 00:18:55,360
...coming up next,
right after this.

259
00:18:55,450 --> 00:18:57,160
I don't believe it.

260
00:18:57,290 --> 00:18:59,080
No offense.
No.

261
00:18:59,170 --> 00:19:00,820
...but when you call,
we'll send you

262
00:19:00,850 --> 00:19:02,360
a second easyfeet
absolutely free!

263
00:19:02,450 --> 00:19:04,040
Just pay separate processing.

264
00:19:04,250 --> 00:19:05,280
So that's two easyfeet...

265
00:19:05,450 --> 00:19:07,560
Now, that, I need to buy that.

266
00:19:11,450 --> 00:19:12,670
He's back.

267
00:19:12,770 --> 00:19:14,720
There's a lady outside.

268
00:19:23,290 --> 00:19:26,640
Dennis, admit what you've done.

269
00:19:26,730 --> 00:19:28,090
Don't get upset.

270
00:19:29,290 --> 00:19:30,720
Don't tell me.

271
00:19:31,370 --> 00:19:33,360
I'm getting frightened.

272
00:19:35,410 --> 00:19:37,640
I thought that you had this
under control.

273
00:19:37,810 --> 00:19:39,880
Please tell me
it's not too late.

274
00:19:40,050 --> 00:19:41,440
The food is waiting.

275
00:19:46,330 --> 00:19:47,800
Is she in that room?

276
00:19:49,490 --> 00:19:51,080
We're here!
Help us!

277
00:19:51,250 --> 00:19:52,390
We're in here!

278
00:19:52,490 --> 00:19:53,800
What is this?
How many are there?

279
00:19:53,930 --> 00:19:55,400
No, don't go in there!

280
00:19:55,490 --> 00:19:56,760
Don't go in there!

281
00:20:06,170 --> 00:20:07,680
Don't worry.

282
00:20:10,010 --> 00:20:11,800
I'll talk to him.

283
00:20:12,850 --> 00:20:15,000
He listens to me.

284
00:20:23,290 --> 00:20:24,920
He's not well.

285
00:20:25,970 --> 00:20:28,160
He knows what you're here for.

286
00:20:28,330 --> 00:20:30,760
He's not allowed to touch you.

287
00:20:30,930 --> 00:20:32,360
He knows that.

288
00:20:34,450 --> 00:20:35,840
Mmm-mmm.

289
00:20:37,890 --> 00:20:39,280
Hmm?

290
00:21:03,690 --> 00:21:05,240
Karen.
Joe.

291
00:21:05,410 --> 00:21:08,720
They said you can't have your own
panel at the national conference.

292
00:21:10,570 --> 00:21:12,480
They conceded, however,

293
00:21:12,650 --> 00:21:14,720
that you can be part of
the mood disorder panel.

294
00:21:14,890 --> 00:21:16,840
It's not a mood disorder.

295
00:21:17,050 --> 00:21:18,720
Oh, I'm aware of
your beliefs, Karen.

296
00:21:19,650 --> 00:21:22,400
Well, were they open this
time with the new evidence?

297
00:21:22,850 --> 00:21:25,150
One of your arguments is a dog?

298
00:21:25,890 --> 00:21:28,320
You submitted video of a
dog acting differently

299
00:21:28,410 --> 00:21:30,240
to one of your patients
at different times?

300
00:21:30,330 --> 00:21:32,080
It is more dramatic than that.

301
00:21:32,410 --> 00:21:35,080
They are what
they believe they are.

302
00:21:35,250 --> 00:21:37,920
The brain has learned
to defend itself.

303
00:21:38,090 --> 00:21:40,370
You speak of them like
they're supernaturally gifted.

304
00:21:41,210 --> 00:21:42,760
Like they have
powers or something.

305
00:21:42,930 --> 00:21:44,520
Karen, these are patients.

306
00:21:44,690 --> 00:21:46,760
They have been through trauma.

307
00:21:49,570 --> 00:21:53,760
And perhaps now they are capable
of something we're not.

308
00:21:55,450 --> 00:21:58,200
We have brain scans now.

309
00:21:58,370 --> 00:22:03,490
DID patients have changed their
body chemistry with their thoughts.

310
00:22:06,530 --> 00:22:08,440
He's just trying to scare us.

311
00:22:08,970 --> 00:22:11,640
He was having a full
conversation with himself.

312
00:22:13,730 --> 00:22:16,440
What was that line about?
"The food is waiting."

313
00:22:17,210 --> 00:22:19,160
Does everyone get
how wacked this is

314
00:22:19,250 --> 00:22:21,200
and that we need to
get out of here now?

315
00:22:30,010 --> 00:22:31,800
No.

316
00:22:32,170 --> 00:22:34,400
Please, keep your area neat.

317
00:22:34,570 --> 00:22:36,320
The bathroom, it's unacceptable.

318
00:22:36,490 --> 00:22:38,640
To make it easy,
I've color-coded these.

319
00:22:38,810 --> 00:22:41,370
Use the blue bottle
for the floor

320
00:22:41,450 --> 00:22:44,440
and the pink bottle
for the ceramic surfaces.

321
00:22:48,610 --> 00:22:50,160
Uh...

322
00:23:08,290 --> 00:23:13,840
Patricia has reminded me that I
was sent to get you for a reason.

323
00:23:14,010 --> 00:23:16,840
That you are sacred food.

324
00:23:18,530 --> 00:23:20,990
And I promise
not to bother you again.

325
00:23:34,170 --> 00:23:36,440
Maybe he has a dog or something.

326
00:23:36,850 --> 00:23:39,200
You think he's gonna
feed us to his dogs?

327
00:24:13,330 --> 00:24:14,520
Casey.

328
00:24:16,290 --> 00:24:17,480
Casey!

329
00:24:36,010 --> 00:24:37,400
My name's Hedwig.

330
00:24:37,570 --> 00:24:39,320
I have red socks.

331
00:24:45,810 --> 00:24:48,080
He's on the move.

332
00:24:51,050 --> 00:24:52,050
What?

333
00:24:55,810 --> 00:24:56,810
He's...

334
00:24:57,210 --> 00:24:58,210
on...

335
00:24:58,450 --> 00:24:59,450
the...

336
00:24:59,770 --> 00:25:01,600
move.

337
00:25:03,690 --> 00:25:04,750
Who?

338
00:25:05,730 --> 00:25:07,640
Someone's coming for you

339
00:25:07,810 --> 00:25:10,600
and you're not gonna like it.

340
00:25:10,770 --> 00:25:12,840
You guys make noises
in your sleep.

341
00:25:13,010 --> 00:25:14,010
Tell us.

342
00:25:15,090 --> 00:25:17,000
I'm not supposed to say.

343
00:25:18,170 --> 00:25:21,000
But he's done
awful things to people

344
00:25:21,130 --> 00:25:22,920
and he'll do
awful things to you.

345
00:25:23,130 --> 00:25:24,440
I have blue socks, too.

346
00:25:24,610 --> 00:25:26,160
We're his food?

347
00:25:30,410 --> 00:25:32,320
How old are you?

348
00:25:33,050 --> 00:25:34,190
Nine.

349
00:25:36,650 --> 00:25:40,560
So you're not the guy
that took us?

350
00:25:41,090 --> 00:25:42,400
No.

351
00:25:44,610 --> 00:25:46,120
You're not the lady?

352
00:25:46,290 --> 00:25:47,960
What are you, blind?

353
00:25:48,650 --> 00:25:50,920
You don't know how they think?

354
00:25:51,570 --> 00:25:53,950
No, they don't tell me much.

355
00:25:54,130 --> 00:25:55,760
I just ate a hot dog.

356
00:25:57,170 --> 00:26:00,320
Could you help us, Hedwig?

357
00:26:01,850 --> 00:26:04,600
No, I'm not even
supposed to be here.

358
00:26:04,770 --> 00:26:07,680
I stole the light from Mr. Dennis,
but he'll be back real soon.

359
00:26:07,850 --> 00:26:12,080
I can't steal the light for too
long or he'll know and get angry.

360
00:26:12,410 --> 00:26:13,550
Etcetera.

361
00:26:16,250 --> 00:26:17,250
See you!

362
00:26:17,410 --> 00:26:18,520
Wait.

363
00:26:22,250 --> 00:26:24,040
We heard something.

364
00:26:25,970 --> 00:26:28,600
We didn't understand it,

365
00:26:30,170 --> 00:26:31,600
but now we do.

366
00:26:34,450 --> 00:26:36,560
Do you know what we heard?

367
00:26:36,850 --> 00:26:38,840
What did you hear?

368
00:26:39,890 --> 00:26:41,400
Come here.

369
00:26:43,650 --> 00:26:45,400
I'll whisper it to you.

370
00:26:47,650 --> 00:26:48,840
Okay.

371
00:27:01,170 --> 00:27:02,480
This guy

372
00:27:06,210 --> 00:27:08,160
is coming for you.

373
00:27:13,050 --> 00:27:14,600
You're a big fibber.

374
00:27:14,770 --> 00:27:16,360
I never lie, Hedwig.

375
00:27:17,530 --> 00:27:19,040
But Mr. Dennis,

376
00:27:19,770 --> 00:27:23,000
he said that he followed
those two girls for four days

377
00:27:23,250 --> 00:27:25,160
and that he knew

378
00:27:25,250 --> 00:27:28,040
that they were the ones
that he would want.

379
00:27:30,770 --> 00:27:32,840
When you're not around,

380
00:27:32,970 --> 00:27:35,080
Dennis and the lady
talk about it.

381
00:27:35,250 --> 00:27:38,040
They talk about how he wants
a boy this time.

382
00:27:38,210 --> 00:27:39,640
They're going to give him you.

383
00:27:39,850 --> 00:27:42,080
No, Miss Patricia, she said...

384
00:27:42,770 --> 00:27:44,680
She said she's not mad
at me anymore.

385
00:27:44,850 --> 00:27:46,760
She sings to me sometimes.

386
00:27:46,930 --> 00:27:50,000
I think Miss Patricia
is still a little mad at you.

387
00:27:50,890 --> 00:27:52,960
Miss Patricia thinks I'm...

388
00:27:53,530 --> 00:27:55,080
She thinks I'm stupid.

389
00:27:56,530 --> 00:27:58,720
She thinks I make
silly mistakes.

390
00:27:59,410 --> 00:28:00,470
Look at me.

391
00:28:01,170 --> 00:28:03,600
We're like your babysitters.

392
00:28:05,330 --> 00:28:08,440
We'll let you watch TV
and make you a fun dinner.

393
00:28:10,610 --> 00:28:13,120
We all need to get out of here.

394
00:28:13,490 --> 00:28:15,680
You could show us the way out.

395
00:28:15,850 --> 00:28:18,310
We could be gone
before anybody gets back,

396
00:28:18,490 --> 00:28:20,440
but we have to hurry, Hedwig.

397
00:28:20,610 --> 00:28:23,070
We have to hurry
and get out of here.

398
00:28:26,490 --> 00:28:27,710
Wait a minute.

399
00:28:29,170 --> 00:28:31,080
It took forever to
get this place safe

400
00:28:31,250 --> 00:28:33,290
without the nosey bodies
that work here finding out.

401
00:28:33,410 --> 00:28:35,000
You can't get out of here!

402
00:28:35,170 --> 00:28:36,170
I have to blow my nose.

403
00:28:36,330 --> 00:28:37,880
No, wait!
Please don't go!

404
00:28:40,210 --> 00:28:41,400
Who's coming?

405
00:28:42,770 --> 00:28:44,480
This is seriously scary.

406
00:28:44,650 --> 00:28:45,960
No one's coming.

407
00:28:50,450 --> 00:28:52,080
He said something.

408
00:28:54,090 --> 00:28:58,000
He said something
about making the room safe.

409
00:28:58,890 --> 00:29:00,440
This is all new drywall.

410
00:29:02,130 --> 00:29:03,800
What was unsafe?

411
00:29:38,570 --> 00:29:39,570
Wait.

412
00:29:40,490 --> 00:29:42,320
Wait, are we sure about this?

413
00:30:03,650 --> 00:30:06,640
Casey, you were right.

414
00:30:07,330 --> 00:30:08,640
There's something here.

415
00:30:09,090 --> 00:30:10,960
He was covering up a way out.

416
00:30:11,410 --> 00:30:12,960
Tell me if you see him.

417
00:30:16,730 --> 00:30:18,480
Casey, tell us what you see.

418
00:30:25,810 --> 00:30:26,870
He's here.

419
00:30:27,570 --> 00:30:29,250
You can't let him in!
You can't let him in!

420
00:30:29,330 --> 00:30:30,880
This is our one chance.

421
00:30:33,170 --> 00:30:34,370
We're not gonna make it.

422
00:30:34,570 --> 00:30:35,710
Yes, we are!

423
00:30:44,410 --> 00:30:45,410
What?

424
00:30:46,210 --> 00:30:47,680
Hey, what are you guys doing?

425
00:30:51,810 --> 00:30:52,810
Hey.

426
00:30:54,330 --> 00:30:56,000
Okay, quit it.

427
00:30:56,490 --> 00:30:57,680
Okay, guys?

428
00:30:58,170 --> 00:30:59,200
Let me in.

429
00:30:59,370 --> 00:31:02,160
Give us a second.
We're changing.

430
00:31:02,650 --> 00:31:03,870
What are you guys doing?

431
00:31:05,930 --> 00:31:07,070
Let me in.

432
00:31:09,650 --> 00:31:11,240
Guys, you're not being funny.

433
00:31:22,170 --> 00:31:24,240
You're being bitches!
Now, I'm gonna slap you!

434
00:31:24,450 --> 00:31:25,690
I'm gonna slap you in your face.

435
00:31:25,770 --> 00:31:27,520
Just give me
as much time as you can.

436
00:31:29,010 --> 00:31:31,000
You're gonna get me
into trouble.

437
00:31:34,930 --> 00:31:35,930
Guys...

438
00:31:38,050 --> 00:31:39,520
All right, push up.

439
00:32:45,770 --> 00:32:46,770
Hey!

440
00:32:51,730 --> 00:32:52,870
Hey!

441
00:32:59,330 --> 00:33:00,720
Hey!

442
00:33:26,290 --> 00:33:28,800
I thought I lost you.

443
00:33:31,850 --> 00:33:33,320
Would you, uh...

444
00:33:34,370 --> 00:33:36,360
Would you step outside, please?

445
00:33:43,490 --> 00:33:45,680
You like to make fun of us.

446
00:33:45,850 --> 00:33:48,360
But we're more powerful
than you think.

447
00:33:48,530 --> 00:33:50,040
Step outside.

448
00:33:52,850 --> 00:33:53,850
Please.

449
00:34:02,490 --> 00:34:04,790
You shouldn't trick children.

450
00:34:05,730 --> 00:34:07,800
That shows who you are.

451
00:34:13,810 --> 00:34:15,840
Look at your sweater.
It's ruined.

452
00:34:16,010 --> 00:34:17,520
It's dirty.

453
00:34:19,730 --> 00:34:20,950
Remove it.

454
00:34:52,490 --> 00:34:54,160
I'm trying to be good.

455
00:35:10,690 --> 00:35:12,480
You will not see
your friend again.

456
00:35:14,570 --> 00:35:16,870
She will be kept separate.

457
00:35:19,770 --> 00:35:22,230
You take off your skirt.
You take off your shirt.

458
00:35:22,410 --> 00:35:24,560
Clothes you got
all dirty from the dust.

459
00:35:48,010 --> 00:35:54,040
One identity in an individual with
Dissociative Identity Disorder

460
00:35:54,130 --> 00:35:55,350
can have high cholesterol.

461
00:35:55,530 --> 00:35:56,530
One.

462
00:35:56,690 --> 00:36:00,600
There have been cases where one
identity is allergic to bee stings.

463
00:36:00,810 --> 00:36:02,120
The others are not.

464
00:36:02,290 --> 00:36:07,120
Are there moments where two identities
can coexist at the same time?

465
00:36:07,290 --> 00:36:10,000
There are times
when two identities

466
00:36:10,090 --> 00:36:13,280
can take the "light"
or "the spot"

467
00:36:13,490 --> 00:36:15,870
or consciousness
at the same time.

468
00:36:16,050 --> 00:36:19,040
This happened with a student
that I was working with.

469
00:36:19,210 --> 00:36:22,960
And her left and right hand
were taking notes

470
00:36:23,130 --> 00:36:27,680
in different handwritings about
separate things at the same time.

471
00:36:28,170 --> 00:36:31,760
The differences in the
identities can be dramatic.

472
00:36:31,930 --> 00:36:35,600
As much as the difference
between you and me

473
00:36:35,770 --> 00:36:38,880
and every person
in that auditorium.

474
00:36:39,890 --> 00:36:41,680
The identities
have different IQs.

475
00:36:41,890 --> 00:36:43,760
They have different
physical strengths.

476
00:36:43,930 --> 00:36:47,240
One personality is
a Russian weightlifter

477
00:36:47,330 --> 00:36:50,680
and can lift three times
his body weight.

478
00:36:51,250 --> 00:36:53,810
Their ability to hyper-focus

479
00:36:53,970 --> 00:36:57,480
and have different
experiences is astounding.

480
00:36:59,970 --> 00:37:04,360
Have these individuals,
through their suffering,

481
00:37:04,530 --> 00:37:07,640
unlocked the potential
of the brain?

482
00:37:09,210 --> 00:37:12,680
Is this the ultimate doorway

483
00:37:13,770 --> 00:37:17,440
to all things we call unknown?

484
00:37:19,410 --> 00:37:24,120
Is this where our sense of
the supernatural comes from?

485
00:37:37,890 --> 00:37:39,840
It's about depth

486
00:37:41,850 --> 00:37:43,440
and curves...

487
00:37:43,610 --> 00:37:44,920
Hey, you see that one?

488
00:37:45,090 --> 00:37:47,360
It's kind of like
a chenille sweater-dress.

489
00:37:51,410 --> 00:37:52,760
Who are you?

490
00:37:57,770 --> 00:37:58,990
Barry.

491
00:38:00,770 --> 00:38:02,360
I don't think you are.

492
00:38:04,090 --> 00:38:06,550
I've developed
a nose for sensing

493
00:38:06,650 --> 00:38:08,880
whom I'm talking to
and whom I'm not.

494
00:38:10,210 --> 00:38:11,760
Have I done something?

495
00:38:11,930 --> 00:38:14,600
You've emailed for
an unscheduled appointment

496
00:38:14,770 --> 00:38:16,400
two days in a row.

497
00:38:16,890 --> 00:38:18,920
We're just feeling overwhelmed.

498
00:38:19,530 --> 00:38:21,320
Garden-variety issues.

499
00:38:22,410 --> 00:38:27,270
I think Orwell or Jade
or Samuel or Heinrich

500
00:38:27,450 --> 00:38:29,880
had the light for a moment
and emailed me.

501
00:38:30,050 --> 00:38:32,480
And you're here to
tell me everything's okay.

502
00:38:32,810 --> 00:38:34,560
I emailed you.

503
00:38:36,770 --> 00:38:39,040
May I talk to
one of them, please?

504
00:38:43,530 --> 00:38:45,320
That can't happen.

505
00:38:45,650 --> 00:38:46,870
I...

506
00:38:47,050 --> 00:38:48,720
I told them that I wanted to

507
00:38:48,810 --> 00:38:50,760
spend the session
with you today.

508
00:38:52,170 --> 00:38:54,360
I'm gonna ask again.

509
00:38:54,970 --> 00:38:58,280
To whom am I speaking with now?

510
00:38:58,810 --> 00:39:01,720
Dr. Fletcher, it's Barry.

511
00:39:02,490 --> 00:39:05,050
It doesn't seem like Barry.

512
00:39:05,210 --> 00:39:07,510
Barry is an extroverted leader.

513
00:39:07,690 --> 00:39:08,830
Yes, I am.

514
00:39:11,130 --> 00:39:13,400
I'm gonna take
a professional guess

515
00:39:13,570 --> 00:39:17,400
based on the description
of all 23 identities

516
00:39:17,490 --> 00:39:19,520
that live in Kevin's body,

517
00:39:20,050 --> 00:39:22,120
that I've gotten from Barry.

518
00:39:24,370 --> 00:39:28,040
I think I'm talking to Dennis.

519
00:39:31,370 --> 00:39:33,160
But he's been banned
from the light

520
00:39:33,250 --> 00:39:35,360
because, among other reasons,

521
00:39:35,730 --> 00:39:40,160
he has a proclivity to watch
young girls dance naked,

522
00:39:40,330 --> 00:39:42,160
which he himself knows is wrong

523
00:39:42,250 --> 00:39:44,710
and has fought against
with little success.

524
00:39:44,890 --> 00:39:47,560
I'm encouraged
we can finally meet.

525
00:39:47,730 --> 00:39:48,920
And I've guessed this

526
00:39:49,090 --> 00:39:52,920
because you've adjusted the chocolate
dish twice since you came in here

527
00:39:53,010 --> 00:39:54,760
and I understand you have OCD.

528
00:39:56,250 --> 00:39:58,440
I see. Now, I see.
That's clever.

529
00:39:58,610 --> 00:40:00,560
That's clever,
but I'm not Dennis.

530
00:40:00,730 --> 00:40:03,960
And you and Patricia have
been banned from the light

531
00:40:04,050 --> 00:40:05,680
for quite a while now.

532
00:40:05,770 --> 00:40:08,150
Primarily, shall we say,
because of your beliefs.

533
00:40:08,330 --> 00:40:10,480
Patricia and Dennis
are very unstable.

534
00:40:10,650 --> 00:40:12,040
I'm not Dennis.

535
00:40:12,210 --> 00:40:14,240
Have you both taken charge now?

536
00:40:14,410 --> 00:40:17,000
Please believe me, I'm Barry.

537
00:40:23,970 --> 00:40:25,400
You must forgive me.

538
00:40:25,570 --> 00:40:28,080
My job is to challenge you.

539
00:40:28,690 --> 00:40:30,800
And, as you must know by now,

540
00:40:30,970 --> 00:40:32,880
I have plenty of opinions about

541
00:40:32,970 --> 00:40:34,840
how everyone should live
their lives.

542
00:40:37,130 --> 00:40:38,920
Ask me something about fashion.

543
00:40:39,130 --> 00:40:40,400
I'll prove it.

544
00:40:41,130 --> 00:40:42,600
Look, look, look. Lindt.

545
00:40:45,530 --> 00:40:46,670
Yeah, look.

546
00:40:48,530 --> 00:40:50,440
You see? I'm not Dennis.

547
00:40:51,930 --> 00:40:53,600
You want me to do
something else?

548
00:40:53,810 --> 00:40:55,240
You got ice cream?

549
00:40:55,410 --> 00:40:57,440
Oh, this shirt's
a cotton blend anyway

550
00:40:57,530 --> 00:40:59,520
and the collar is
from three seasons ago.

551
00:40:59,730 --> 00:41:01,840
Snood? I mean, come on.

552
00:41:20,850 --> 00:41:23,040
Jai, what health-conscious
fast food purveyor

553
00:41:23,210 --> 00:41:25,290
did you originally solicit
to buy these chicken wings

554
00:41:25,450 --> 00:41:28,480
you've so lovingly reheated
in a minor suicidal gesture?

555
00:41:28,650 --> 00:41:30,890
Hooters. And you can't just
throw them out, Dr. Fletcher.

556
00:41:30,930 --> 00:41:32,880
Oh, this is wrong
on so many levels.

557
00:41:33,050 --> 00:41:36,520
We finished about 3:15,
so look around 3:18.

558
00:41:37,370 --> 00:41:39,770
You're getting a little soft
around the middle, Jai. Mmm-hmm.

559
00:41:41,090 --> 00:41:44,040
The authors of Hooters play
on our incessant need for fat

560
00:41:44,210 --> 00:41:47,990
and man's incessant need to be in
the proximity of augmented breasts.

561
00:41:48,170 --> 00:41:51,680
It's like Henry V
ran a fast food franchise.

562
00:41:51,850 --> 00:41:53,090
It's a good place,
Dr. Fletcher.

563
00:41:53,210 --> 00:41:54,480
Right.

564
00:41:55,850 --> 00:41:57,920
How'd you know
the trash would be spilled?

565
00:41:58,090 --> 00:41:59,440
How can I say this, Jai?

566
00:41:59,530 --> 00:42:02,120
You're not the most
meticulous of people.

567
00:42:18,930 --> 00:42:20,100
This guy isn't very neat, is he?

568
00:42:20,130 --> 00:42:21,300
He walked
right through the trash.

569
00:42:21,330 --> 00:42:22,470
No, Jai.

570
00:42:22,690 --> 00:42:24,880
Any normal person
would have walked around it.

571
00:42:25,050 --> 00:42:27,120
That was an act.

572
00:42:28,370 --> 00:42:30,520
What are you up to, Dennis?

573
00:42:31,650 --> 00:42:35,400
Or is it Patricia
who's deciding things?

574
00:42:37,810 --> 00:42:39,400
We're not gonna die.

575
00:42:40,650 --> 00:42:42,440
Bad things happen.

576
00:42:43,650 --> 00:42:45,480
But not like this.

577
00:42:46,570 --> 00:42:47,570
Casey...

578
00:42:49,210 --> 00:42:50,680
Talk to me.

579
00:42:53,170 --> 00:42:56,240
We need to get to a window
or a door, or something.

580
00:42:56,410 --> 00:42:57,800
Don't you think?

581
00:43:12,530 --> 00:43:15,800
The thrill, Casey,
is about whether you can

582
00:43:15,890 --> 00:43:19,160
or can't outsmart this animal.

583
00:43:22,610 --> 00:43:24,910
See, you didn't used to
like to come out here.

584
00:43:25,130 --> 00:43:27,430
This is like our
family tradition, right?

585
00:43:28,810 --> 00:43:30,200
Good shot, big brother.

586
00:43:31,090 --> 00:43:32,400
Thank you, John.

587
00:43:39,970 --> 00:43:42,320
I have your meal, sleepyhead.

588
00:43:47,410 --> 00:43:48,600
Eat.

589
00:43:55,570 --> 00:43:56,790
It's good?

590
00:43:58,010 --> 00:44:00,440
It's got paprika in it.

591
00:44:03,970 --> 00:44:05,760
I'm sorry.

592
00:44:07,090 --> 00:44:11,200
I think I'll put a pretty
flower in your hair.

593
00:44:13,650 --> 00:44:14,840
There we are.

594
00:44:22,290 --> 00:44:24,750
That's to show
how important you are.

595
00:44:25,650 --> 00:44:26,650
Come along.

596
00:44:26,810 --> 00:44:28,640
We'll have a proper meal.

597
00:44:32,490 --> 00:44:33,600
I understand.

598
00:44:33,770 --> 00:44:36,280
This must all seem
so unsatisfactory for you.

599
00:44:36,490 --> 00:44:39,400
But we are doing
the best we can.

600
00:44:58,850 --> 00:44:59,990
Good?

601
00:45:02,930 --> 00:45:04,200
Hmm?

602
00:45:06,810 --> 00:45:08,360
Can Claire come eat with us?

603
00:45:08,530 --> 00:45:09,530
No.

604
00:45:10,330 --> 00:45:12,520
No, I'm afraid
that can't happen.

605
00:45:13,010 --> 00:45:16,840
She almost ruined
our big reception.

606
00:45:18,170 --> 00:45:19,360
Mmm...

607
00:45:23,130 --> 00:45:26,400
I've heard that Asian people's
music aids digestion.

608
00:45:28,370 --> 00:45:30,640
I'll make you a second sandwich.

609
00:45:35,010 --> 00:45:36,200
Do you know,

610
00:45:37,090 --> 00:45:42,030
a family of lions
can eat 35 pounds a day?

611
00:45:44,690 --> 00:45:48,720
A buck can lose 30% of its
weight during mating season,

612
00:45:48,890 --> 00:45:50,360
chasing does around.

613
00:45:50,530 --> 00:45:52,200
They're crepuscular, right?

614
00:45:53,490 --> 00:45:56,560
It means they travel around
during dusk and dawn.

615
00:45:56,730 --> 00:45:57,870
Good for you.

616
00:46:14,290 --> 00:46:15,600
It's crooked.

617
00:46:16,890 --> 00:46:18,280
Forgive me.

618
00:46:28,410 --> 00:46:32,920
I don't know if you know,
but tigers have only 30 teeth.

619
00:46:34,890 --> 00:46:38,120
That's 12 less than a dog.

620
00:46:38,250 --> 00:46:40,240
I thought that was a fun fact.

621
00:46:40,970 --> 00:46:41,970
No.

622
00:46:46,810 --> 00:46:47,810
Marcia.

623
00:46:48,450 --> 00:46:49,800
Marcia, listen to me.

624
00:47:14,090 --> 00:47:15,920
Go to your room.
Shut the door.

625
00:47:16,090 --> 00:47:17,150
Do it now.

626
00:47:52,170 --> 00:47:56,680
"In the sun,
we will find our passion.

627
00:47:58,010 --> 00:48:02,520
"In the sun,
we will find our purpose."

628
00:48:08,530 --> 00:48:10,680
You've always been protected.

629
00:48:10,850 --> 00:48:12,960
You've never truly suffered.

630
00:48:13,130 --> 00:48:16,040
And that's why we chose you.

631
00:48:16,250 --> 00:48:18,240
You've always been asleep.

632
00:48:21,850 --> 00:48:23,880
You never had a chance.

633
00:48:28,690 --> 00:48:30,680
You never had a chance.

634
00:48:32,370 --> 00:48:35,480
The dark-haired girl,
she's gonna be kept in another closet.

635
00:48:35,690 --> 00:48:37,130
You might as well know
at this point.

636
00:48:37,890 --> 00:48:39,560
The Beast,

637
00:48:39,730 --> 00:48:41,520
he's coming for you.

638
00:48:42,370 --> 00:48:45,160
All three of you, you're
gonna be kept separate.

639
00:48:46,650 --> 00:48:48,400
You've got...

640
00:48:48,570 --> 00:48:50,720
You've got a crumb
on your shirt.

641
00:48:53,050 --> 00:48:54,560
Please take it off.

642
00:48:55,050 --> 00:48:56,050
Just...

643
00:48:58,050 --> 00:48:59,480
Just take it off.

644
00:49:16,050 --> 00:49:17,050
Hey.

645
00:49:23,090 --> 00:49:25,600
Ah.

646
00:49:50,530 --> 00:49:53,280
It wasn't nice,
what you said about Miss Patricia.

647
00:49:54,210 --> 00:49:55,720
You lied.

648
00:50:00,250 --> 00:50:02,200
I'm sorry about that, Hedwig.

649
00:50:03,210 --> 00:50:07,600
You guys lied to me,
made me scared, etcetera.

650
00:50:10,890 --> 00:50:14,080
Mr. Dennis, he says
you wear a lot of shirts.

651
00:50:14,290 --> 00:50:15,640
I like this shirt.

652
00:50:16,570 --> 00:50:17,760
Thank you.

653
00:50:18,130 --> 00:50:20,640
Do you know who Dennis
and Miss Patricia are?

654
00:50:20,810 --> 00:50:22,320
No.

655
00:50:24,290 --> 00:50:27,800
Every one of us
has to wait in a chair,

656
00:50:28,570 --> 00:50:32,720
and Barry, he decides
who stands in the light.

657
00:50:32,930 --> 00:50:35,800
But Barry lost that power
because of me.

658
00:50:37,490 --> 00:50:41,000
I can wish myself into the
light anytime I want.

659
00:50:41,810 --> 00:50:44,000
It's a special power.

660
00:50:45,090 --> 00:50:48,680
Barry just has to keep sitting
in his chair if I want him to.

661
00:50:50,330 --> 00:50:53,520
That's why Dennis and Miss Patricia
said I could be with them.

662
00:50:54,690 --> 00:50:58,080
Dennis and Miss Patricia,
they believe in The Beast

663
00:50:58,290 --> 00:51:00,000
and what he can do.

664
00:51:01,330 --> 00:51:03,840
Have you seen him?

665
00:51:07,370 --> 00:51:08,840
The Beast?

666
00:51:10,290 --> 00:51:12,200
No. Can I kiss you?

667
00:51:13,610 --> 00:51:15,420
I wanted to kiss the other
girl with the dark hair,

668
00:51:15,450 --> 00:51:17,040
but she's in trouble.

669
00:51:21,170 --> 00:51:22,360
So, do you want to?

670
00:51:22,490 --> 00:51:24,100
I mean, I don't know
much about kissing, though.

671
00:51:24,130 --> 00:51:25,130
Yeah.

672
00:51:28,650 --> 00:51:29,960
Okay.

673
00:51:30,730 --> 00:51:31,950
Uh...

674
00:51:32,370 --> 00:51:34,120
Okay, here we go.

675
00:51:36,570 --> 00:51:37,630
One...

676
00:51:37,730 --> 00:51:38,730
Two...

677
00:51:39,730 --> 00:51:40,730
Three.

678
00:51:56,250 --> 00:51:57,880
You might be pregnant now.

679
00:52:00,370 --> 00:52:01,920
Am I a good kisser?

680
00:52:03,010 --> 00:52:04,010
Yeah.

681
00:52:04,570 --> 00:52:05,570
I like dancing.

682
00:52:05,770 --> 00:52:07,560
Do you like dancing?

683
00:52:07,730 --> 00:52:11,240
I like dancing to
my CD player in my room.

684
00:52:11,610 --> 00:52:13,600
Kanye West is my main man.

685
00:52:14,770 --> 00:52:17,440
We got my CD player
set up in my room,

686
00:52:17,530 --> 00:52:19,040
right next to my window.

687
00:52:19,850 --> 00:52:20,850
I'm like...

688
00:52:27,970 --> 00:52:28,970
We gots the moves.

689
00:52:29,290 --> 00:52:30,290
Wow.

690
00:52:32,530 --> 00:52:35,960
Maybe I could watch you dance

691
00:52:36,050 --> 00:52:38,680
and listen to music with you.

692
00:52:39,970 --> 00:52:42,040
No, my music's in my room.

693
00:52:42,610 --> 00:52:44,280
Oh. Right.

694
00:52:46,810 --> 00:52:47,810
Maybe

695
00:52:48,770 --> 00:52:50,440
you could sneak me there.

696
00:52:51,930 --> 00:52:53,840
Are you trying to trick me?

697
00:52:54,610 --> 00:52:55,960
Etcetera?

698
00:52:57,090 --> 00:52:58,480
I'll tell on you.

699
00:52:58,970 --> 00:53:00,190
I'm telling on you.

700
00:53:00,410 --> 00:53:01,630
I'll tell you something.

701
00:53:02,570 --> 00:53:04,640
And you can tell me
if I'm lying or not, okay?

702
00:53:04,810 --> 00:53:06,880
Mmm-hmm.
Like a test. Okay?

703
00:53:12,330 --> 00:53:17,160
I get into trouble
at school, on purpose.

704
00:53:21,410 --> 00:53:23,920
So I can get sent to detention.

705
00:53:28,490 --> 00:53:32,110
To get away from everyone.

706
00:53:38,650 --> 00:53:40,680
So that I can be alone.

707
00:53:52,210 --> 00:53:55,320
Okay, I'll show you
something cool in my room.

708
00:53:56,210 --> 00:53:57,430
Okay.

709
00:53:57,610 --> 00:54:00,920
But after Mr. Dennis has finished
his getting-ready ritual.

710
00:54:01,530 --> 00:54:02,880
I have to go.

711
00:54:03,050 --> 00:54:04,480
He's got an appointment.

712
00:54:04,650 --> 00:54:05,680
When I fall asleep,

713
00:54:05,890 --> 00:54:07,500
one of the others keeps trying
to reach the doctor lady

714
00:54:07,530 --> 00:54:08,670
to tell on us.

715
00:54:09,450 --> 00:54:11,720
That pant,
it's got a red lining.

716
00:54:11,890 --> 00:54:14,160
You can see it in
the long slit down the side.

717
00:54:15,210 --> 00:54:19,040
We have been talking about
silk-and-wool blend for 20 minutes.

718
00:54:19,890 --> 00:54:22,720
Can I guess that you emailed
me in the middle of the night

719
00:54:22,890 --> 00:54:28,480
for an emergency session
due to garden-variety issues?

720
00:54:30,730 --> 00:54:35,480
I was down and I emailed you and
I woke up and I feel better.

721
00:54:35,650 --> 00:54:37,400
I feel better.

722
00:54:39,410 --> 00:54:40,720
I had a thought.

723
00:54:41,090 --> 00:54:42,090
Mmm-mmm.

724
00:54:42,170 --> 00:54:44,680
I want to talk about
the incident at work.

725
00:54:45,170 --> 00:54:46,680
It's okay, Barry.

726
00:54:46,890 --> 00:54:48,030
You're safe.

727
00:54:48,530 --> 00:54:50,990
I just want to bring
the details back.

728
00:54:51,170 --> 00:54:53,200
We'll just talk
about the details.

729
00:54:55,410 --> 00:54:57,790
A high school from
Camden, New Jersey

730
00:54:57,890 --> 00:55:01,080
was on a field trip
at your place of work

731
00:55:01,250 --> 00:55:03,520
and two young ladies
came up to you.

732
00:55:03,690 --> 00:55:06,440
And one took your hand

733
00:55:06,610 --> 00:55:08,480
and put it under her shirt
on her breast

734
00:55:08,570 --> 00:55:09,770
and the second one did the same

735
00:55:09,930 --> 00:55:12,840
and then they just ran off
laughing to their friends.

736
00:55:13,010 --> 00:55:15,600
You surmised that it
might be on a dare.

737
00:55:15,770 --> 00:55:18,230
You said they were 17 or 18.

738
00:55:18,410 --> 00:55:20,280
You said it upset you for days.

739
00:55:20,450 --> 00:55:23,600
It was just a teenage prank.
I get that now.

740
00:55:24,610 --> 00:55:27,280
And see, that's my mistake.

741
00:55:27,450 --> 00:55:31,600
I believe that I went over this
incident with you too fast.

742
00:55:32,290 --> 00:55:34,800
Although you said you were fine,

743
00:55:34,970 --> 00:55:39,120
and the other identities
I met with said it was fine,

744
00:55:39,290 --> 00:55:43,440
I believe that
this brought up issues

745
00:55:43,530 --> 00:55:46,320
from when you were
a child and abused.

746
00:55:46,490 --> 00:55:49,080
Sometimes another
incident of abuse

747
00:55:49,290 --> 00:55:52,120
can cause suppressed
personalities to take the light.

748
00:55:52,770 --> 00:55:55,640
Dennis, if this is you,

749
00:55:55,810 --> 00:55:58,110
I completely understand

750
00:55:58,210 --> 00:56:02,360
why you felt the need to take
over and protect the others.

751
00:56:02,450 --> 00:56:03,480
Please!

752
00:56:03,610 --> 00:56:05,160
Doctor, not this again.

753
00:56:05,330 --> 00:56:06,550
The others told me

754
00:56:06,730 --> 00:56:10,760
that you and Patricia told
the group about this Beast.

755
00:56:10,930 --> 00:56:14,160
And I told them that these
are just scary stories

756
00:56:14,330 --> 00:56:18,680
that Dennis and Patricia tell
the others to scare them.

757
00:56:18,850 --> 00:56:21,280
How this Beast
can crawl on walls,

758
00:56:21,490 --> 00:56:25,840
like the best rock climbers using the
slightest friction and imperfections

759
00:56:26,010 --> 00:56:30,160
to hold his body close
to seemingly sheer surfaces.

760
00:56:30,850 --> 00:56:35,440
How his skin is thick and tough
like the hide of a rhinoceros.

761
00:56:37,690 --> 00:56:42,160
Do you really believe
the stories about The Beast?

762
00:56:43,850 --> 00:56:44,850
Hmm.

763
00:56:44,970 --> 00:56:47,120
If this is you, Dennis,

764
00:56:48,370 --> 00:56:50,960
I understand
why Kevin needs you.

765
00:56:52,610 --> 00:56:55,170
You are strong and disciplined.

766
00:56:55,330 --> 00:56:56,880
You are precise

767
00:56:57,050 --> 00:56:59,640
and you will not be
taken advantage of.

768
00:57:01,530 --> 00:57:03,200
You can trust me.

769
00:57:05,050 --> 00:57:06,270
For example,

770
00:57:06,410 --> 00:57:10,960
I do have the ability to use Kevin's
full name and bring him forward

771
00:57:11,050 --> 00:57:12,520
as he has in the past.

772
00:57:13,410 --> 00:57:15,040
But I wouldn't do that.

773
00:57:15,810 --> 00:57:19,880
I know that that would
be chaos for all of you.

774
00:57:20,090 --> 00:57:21,880
Everyone would grab the light.

775
00:57:22,090 --> 00:57:24,550
I don't want to hurt
any of you that way.

776
00:57:26,250 --> 00:57:28,080
You don't have to hide.

777
00:57:29,410 --> 00:57:32,320
I know you are someone
who cares for Kevin.

778
00:57:34,890 --> 00:57:38,360
You are not evil to me.

779
00:57:40,730 --> 00:57:43,080
You were necessary.

780
00:57:45,530 --> 00:57:46,670
Dennis.

781
00:57:48,090 --> 00:57:49,680
Is that you?

782
00:58:04,610 --> 00:58:06,680
They keep calling us The Horde.

783
00:58:09,210 --> 00:58:10,760
The others, you know?

784
00:58:12,290 --> 00:58:15,800
Miss Patricia and I,
we are ridiculed.

785
00:58:17,210 --> 00:58:21,760
Now, we're not perfect,
but we don't deserve to be ridiculed.

786
00:58:23,290 --> 00:58:26,400
We're all struggling.
They have to admit that.

787
00:58:31,810 --> 00:58:34,560
I am pleased to
meet you, Dennis.

788
00:58:36,570 --> 00:58:37,570
You, too.

789
00:58:40,650 --> 00:58:45,120
I assume you don't know who emailed
me for the emergency sessions?

790
00:58:45,490 --> 00:58:47,000
One of the others.

791
00:58:48,570 --> 00:58:49,570
Are you in charge?

792
00:58:49,730 --> 00:58:51,320
Yeah, we've taken charge.

793
00:58:51,970 --> 00:58:54,240
We're the only ones
that can protect Kevin.

794
00:58:54,410 --> 00:58:56,400
We're all here to protect Kevin.

795
00:58:57,170 --> 00:58:58,640
He's very weak.

796
00:59:01,450 --> 00:59:04,240
He doesn't know
how powerful we can be.

797
00:59:04,410 --> 00:59:07,680
Would you mind telling me when
you first came into existence?

798
00:59:11,170 --> 00:59:14,920
And how you and Patricia,
the other undesirable identity,

799
00:59:15,090 --> 00:59:16,440
became aligned?

800
00:59:19,850 --> 00:59:20,850
That's okay.

801
00:59:21,690 --> 00:59:23,680
Do you still have
strong beliefs?

802
00:59:24,530 --> 00:59:25,920
That depends on what.

803
00:59:26,450 --> 00:59:29,840
This story of The Beast.

804
00:59:35,330 --> 00:59:39,320
One thing, Dennis, that may
comfort you if you are confused

805
00:59:39,490 --> 00:59:42,480
is that you've met
the other alters.

806
00:59:43,210 --> 00:59:46,040
You're all in a room
in chairs, right?

807
00:59:46,810 --> 00:59:48,120
Yeah.

808
00:59:48,530 --> 00:59:50,200
But you never met The Beast.

809
00:59:50,370 --> 00:59:52,830
Because he doesn't reside
with the rest of you.

810
00:59:53,010 --> 00:59:56,040
Because he resides in the train
yard, as the story goes,

811
00:59:56,210 --> 00:59:58,480
because Kevin's dad
left on a train.

812
00:59:58,650 --> 01:00:00,320
But the fact is,

813
01:00:00,810 --> 01:00:03,560
you and Patricia have
never met The Beast.

814
01:00:04,210 --> 01:00:05,210
Have you?

815
01:00:06,570 --> 01:00:07,680
No.

816
01:00:08,650 --> 01:00:10,800
That's because
he's not an alter.

817
01:00:11,850 --> 01:00:14,230
He's not the 24th identity.

818
01:00:16,010 --> 01:00:17,680
He's a fantasy.

819
01:00:37,010 --> 01:00:38,800
Hurry up! Let's go!

820
01:00:39,370 --> 01:00:41,280
Come on, it's time.

821
01:02:07,810 --> 01:02:08,840
Wow.

822
01:02:09,490 --> 01:02:10,630
I know.

823
01:02:12,530 --> 01:02:14,040
This is your CD player?

824
01:02:14,210 --> 01:02:15,350
Yeah.

825
01:02:18,690 --> 01:02:20,080
You don't like it?

826
01:02:21,690 --> 01:02:23,000
It's not new...
No!

827
01:02:23,690 --> 01:02:25,360
No, I'm just, uh...

828
01:02:27,530 --> 01:02:29,320
I'm confused.

829
01:02:29,770 --> 01:02:31,240
You said it was near a window.

830
01:02:31,410 --> 01:02:32,920
Oh, that's here!

831
01:02:34,730 --> 01:02:35,920
Watch.

832
01:02:36,090 --> 01:02:37,400
Now, it's closed.

833
01:02:38,730 --> 01:02:40,000
Now, it's open.

834
01:02:41,410 --> 01:02:42,410
Now, it's closed.

835
01:02:44,050 --> 01:02:45,400
Now, it's open.

836
01:02:54,410 --> 01:02:57,080
Did you think
it was a real window?

837
01:03:00,130 --> 01:03:03,280
So you could leave, etcetera?

838
01:03:05,810 --> 01:03:09,080
Help me get out of here, Hedwig.

839
01:03:10,570 --> 01:03:14,080
Just get me the keys
and let me out the door.

840
01:03:14,810 --> 01:03:15,810
Please.

841
01:03:15,930 --> 01:03:18,360
Miss Patricia says that nobody
will make fun of me anymore

842
01:03:18,490 --> 01:03:20,280
when The Beast comes!

843
01:03:20,370 --> 01:03:22,720
She says that everyone
will see how amazing I am

844
01:03:22,890 --> 01:03:26,160
and then all of the silly mistakes,
they won't matter anymore.

845
01:03:26,250 --> 01:03:28,400
I think you should go
back to your room. No!

846
01:03:28,490 --> 01:03:29,490
Wait, please,

847
01:03:29,610 --> 01:03:31,080
I wanna hear
your Kanye West albums.

848
01:03:31,290 --> 01:03:32,400
Show me your room.

849
01:03:32,570 --> 01:03:34,760
Let's stay here.
I'm sorry I asked to leave.

850
01:03:34,930 --> 01:03:36,240
I can't.

851
01:03:36,410 --> 01:03:37,940
You said you wanted to show
me something cool, right?

852
01:03:37,970 --> 01:03:39,000
No.

853
01:03:39,130 --> 01:03:41,320
Show me something. Please!
I don't want to.

854
01:03:44,490 --> 01:03:45,490
This!

855
01:03:53,290 --> 01:03:54,760
Wow.

856
01:03:55,810 --> 01:03:57,160
It's nice.

857
01:03:57,770 --> 01:03:59,760
It's not a toy.

858
01:04:05,090 --> 01:04:06,360
This is real?

859
01:04:06,530 --> 01:04:07,530
Yes!

860
01:04:09,650 --> 01:04:11,360
It's Mr. Dennis'.

861
01:04:12,930 --> 01:04:14,880
He doesn't even know I stole it.

862
01:04:16,570 --> 01:04:18,870
Pretty cool, right?

863
01:04:20,690 --> 01:04:22,000
You can listen to people talking

864
01:04:22,090 --> 01:04:24,160
and they don't even know
you're listening.

865
01:04:26,650 --> 01:04:28,080
Who does this talk to?

866
01:04:28,250 --> 01:04:29,560
Don't touch that.

867
01:04:30,850 --> 01:04:32,600
I just wanna see if it works.

868
01:04:34,250 --> 01:04:35,800
Hey, what are you doing?

869
01:04:35,890 --> 01:04:37,580
Don't touch those buttons.
You're gonna get us found out.

870
01:04:37,610 --> 01:04:39,680
Yeah, East gate here.
What up?

871
01:04:44,610 --> 01:04:46,000
Don't talk.

872
01:04:46,850 --> 01:04:48,520
What up?
Don't talk.

873
01:04:51,650 --> 01:04:52,650
Hello?

874
01:04:52,690 --> 01:04:53,690
I'm gonna slap you!

875
01:04:53,810 --> 01:04:54,840
Who's this?

876
01:04:57,370 --> 01:04:59,750
Hello. Hello,
my name is Casey Cooke.

877
01:04:59,850 --> 01:05:02,610
I'm being held in a basement.
I've been abducted with two other girls.

878
01:05:03,810 --> 01:05:06,520
Who the hell is this?

879
01:05:15,050 --> 01:05:16,360
Hello?

880
01:05:16,890 --> 01:05:18,480
Casey Cooke.

881
01:05:18,690 --> 01:05:19,750
I've been abducted.

882
01:05:19,850 --> 01:05:21,880
You need to find me.

883
01:05:22,210 --> 01:05:23,350
Betty, is that you?

884
01:05:23,890 --> 01:05:24,950
This isn't funny.

885
01:05:25,130 --> 01:05:27,480
Call the police.
I must be near you.

886
01:05:27,650 --> 01:05:30,210
I'm being held
in a basement or something.

887
01:05:30,410 --> 01:05:31,840
Okay, Betty, listen.

888
01:05:32,010 --> 01:05:33,800
Tell Larry and Fish I said hi.

889
01:05:33,970 --> 01:05:36,120
Tell him I still got
his orange headphones.

890
01:05:36,330 --> 01:05:38,320
I don't know where I am.

891
01:05:38,890 --> 01:05:40,200
There's a man here.

892
01:05:40,370 --> 01:05:42,800
He abducted us
and he's going to kill me.

893
01:05:52,690 --> 01:05:54,880
I only have a few hours left.

894
01:05:59,170 --> 01:06:00,310
Please.

895
01:06:01,930 --> 01:06:03,560
I'm begging you.

896
01:06:04,850 --> 01:06:06,760
Somebody save us.

897
01:06:07,250 --> 01:06:09,040
Wait, who is this?

898
01:06:09,210 --> 01:06:11,920
And how did you get
one of our walkies?

899
01:06:19,690 --> 01:06:22,280
Put your hands
together in contrition.

900
01:06:24,250 --> 01:06:28,360
"In the sun,
we will find our passion.

901
01:06:29,850 --> 01:06:31,880
"In the sun,

902
01:06:31,970 --> 01:06:36,880
"we will find our purpose."

903
01:06:47,130 --> 01:06:50,800
I read that on a sympathy
card in a supermarket.

904
01:06:51,250 --> 01:06:55,080
It was for funerals,
but I thought it was beautiful.

905
01:07:00,170 --> 01:07:04,240
Dennis will explain the
meaning of this evening.

906
01:07:37,650 --> 01:07:41,680
The Beast is a sentient creature

907
01:07:41,930 --> 01:07:45,630
who represents the highest
form of humans' evolution.

908
01:07:45,810 --> 01:07:49,840
He believes the time of
ordinary humanity is over.

909
01:07:51,850 --> 01:07:54,150
I hope this makes you feel calm.

910
01:07:55,650 --> 01:08:01,080
You will be in the presence
of something greater.

911
01:08:01,250 --> 01:08:03,680
I was gonna ask
for your last shirt,

912
01:08:03,850 --> 01:08:05,160
but I won't.

913
01:08:06,010 --> 01:08:08,160
Because tonight
is a sacred night.

914
01:08:09,610 --> 01:08:11,360
It's almost over.

915
01:08:19,290 --> 01:08:21,160
Casey. Come on.

916
01:08:22,330 --> 01:08:24,440
Let's pretend
we're animals again.

917
01:08:24,810 --> 01:08:25,950
Come on.

918
01:08:28,850 --> 01:08:31,150
Casey, come on.
This is our game.

919
01:08:33,410 --> 01:08:35,710
I'll tell your dad
you're not being nice.

920
01:08:56,090 --> 01:08:57,600
Come on, take off your stuff.

921
01:08:58,170 --> 01:08:59,960
Animals don't wear clothes.

922
01:09:00,290 --> 01:09:01,320
Come on.

923
01:09:01,450 --> 01:09:03,000
Yeah, yeah.

924
01:09:03,530 --> 01:09:04,530
Come on.

925
01:09:29,810 --> 01:09:31,440
Hey, Casey bear.

926
01:09:34,610 --> 01:09:36,120
This isn't funny.

927
01:09:40,610 --> 01:09:42,040
Is it loaded?

928
01:09:44,890 --> 01:09:46,110
Casey.

929
01:09:47,970 --> 01:09:49,000
I'm your uncle.

930
01:09:52,410 --> 01:09:54,120
Stop it, Casey.

931
01:09:55,650 --> 01:09:57,160
Put that gun down.

932
01:09:57,410 --> 01:09:58,800
I'm getting upset.

933
01:09:59,250 --> 01:10:00,960
I'm about to get very angry.

934
01:10:01,130 --> 01:10:02,160
Give me the gun!

935
01:10:09,690 --> 01:10:11,200
Could have killed me.

936
01:11:19,130 --> 01:11:21,480
This place is closed. You can't get in.
No, it's okay.

937
01:11:21,570 --> 01:11:23,000
No, it's okay.

938
01:11:29,410 --> 01:11:30,880
Hello, Dennis.

939
01:11:31,690 --> 01:11:34,960
One of the others
emailed me just now.

940
01:11:35,090 --> 01:11:37,120
Is everything okay?

941
01:11:37,210 --> 01:11:38,270
We're fine.

942
01:11:38,930 --> 01:11:40,200
Dennis,

943
01:11:40,370 --> 01:11:42,800
Kevin is really lucky
to have you.

944
01:11:42,970 --> 01:11:45,400
You are quite extraordinary.

945
01:11:45,570 --> 01:11:47,920
I just don't want
you guys to get hurt.

946
01:11:54,050 --> 01:11:56,680
You think we're extraordinary?

947
01:11:57,290 --> 01:11:59,160
I like you, Dennis.

948
01:12:00,010 --> 01:12:01,360
May I come in?

949
01:12:01,770 --> 01:12:03,480
And can we talk?

950
01:12:05,410 --> 01:12:08,080
I know you wanna
tell me something.

951
01:12:09,330 --> 01:12:11,560
Why don't you just tell me?

952
01:12:26,730 --> 01:12:28,840
We're very similar, you and I.

953
01:12:29,010 --> 01:12:31,080
Both on the outside, looking in.

954
01:12:31,290 --> 01:12:32,920
Please, sit.

955
01:12:33,610 --> 01:12:36,040
I don't get many visitors.

956
01:12:36,450 --> 01:12:38,080
Uh, I'll get you some water.

957
01:12:38,450 --> 01:12:40,560
They got a proper
quarters for me

958
01:12:40,650 --> 01:12:42,080
in a building on the south side,

959
01:12:42,250 --> 01:12:44,240
but we prefer it here.

960
01:12:44,810 --> 01:12:46,220
When they promoted me
to head of maintenance,

961
01:12:46,250 --> 01:12:47,680
they said I could have it.

962
01:12:49,010 --> 01:12:51,040
Who are you going to meet?

963
01:12:56,130 --> 01:12:58,280
I wanna talk about

964
01:12:59,610 --> 01:13:00,960
Kevin

965
01:13:03,090 --> 01:13:05,320
and what his mother did to him.

966
01:13:06,770 --> 01:13:08,400
I remember it all.

967
01:13:09,210 --> 01:13:11,920
I'm happy you're
suddenly so open.

968
01:13:12,410 --> 01:13:14,760
Kevin's mother had
rather malevolent ways

969
01:13:14,850 --> 01:13:16,880
of punishing
a three-year-old.

970
01:13:17,690 --> 01:13:19,400
Is that when you arrived
in the light?

971
01:13:19,570 --> 01:13:20,630
Yeah.

972
01:13:22,730 --> 01:13:24,280
The one way to
avoid her attention

973
01:13:24,370 --> 01:13:25,760
was to keep everything spotless,

974
01:13:25,970 --> 01:13:28,240
everything perfect.

975
01:13:30,650 --> 01:13:33,110
I know you're coming from
good intentions, Dennis,

976
01:13:33,290 --> 01:13:35,590
but there are other ways
to help Kevin now.

977
01:13:36,170 --> 01:13:39,870
I've lost so many patients
into the system.

978
01:13:41,210 --> 01:13:44,640
I want you to know, Dennis, I
will never stop fighting for you.

979
01:13:45,290 --> 01:13:48,600
My patients have
become my family.

980
01:13:48,930 --> 01:13:52,360
They are what I've chosen instead
of a more traditional path.

981
01:13:52,530 --> 01:13:55,800
I hope you feel you can
be truly honest with me.

982
01:13:55,970 --> 01:13:58,720
I actually wanna be
honest with you.

983
01:14:00,330 --> 01:14:02,080
I lied before.

984
01:14:02,730 --> 01:14:05,720
When you asked
if I'd ever met The Beast,

985
01:14:06,450 --> 01:14:07,840
I said no.

986
01:14:08,410 --> 01:14:10,200
That really isn't true.

987
01:14:13,170 --> 01:14:18,110
You wrote about a woman in Germany
who'd been blind for 10 years.

988
01:14:18,930 --> 01:14:22,120
And then, it was discovered
that she had DID.

989
01:14:22,650 --> 01:14:26,190
Then three of her identities
developed sight.

990
01:14:26,810 --> 01:14:31,240
And you speculated that her
optical nerves regenerated

991
01:14:31,450 --> 01:14:34,010
because of her beliefs.

992
01:14:34,090 --> 01:14:36,080
What are you trying to say?

993
01:14:36,250 --> 01:14:38,240
There are things,
Dr. Fletcher,

994
01:14:38,330 --> 01:14:40,320
that all of us would
find hard to believe.

995
01:14:40,930 --> 01:14:43,840
Are you trying to tell me
there's a 24th identity?

996
01:14:44,050 --> 01:14:45,800
You protect the broken.

997
01:14:46,450 --> 01:14:50,040
When you said that you thought
this situation was extraordinary,

998
01:14:50,210 --> 01:14:52,560
I knew you can maybe understand.

999
01:14:52,730 --> 01:14:54,160
Understand what?

1000
01:14:54,330 --> 01:14:55,520
The Beast

1001
01:14:57,130 --> 01:14:58,800
is real.

1002
01:14:59,730 --> 01:15:01,400
He's just emerged.

1003
01:15:01,570 --> 01:15:04,000
You were right about everything.

1004
01:15:05,010 --> 01:15:06,640
What does he look like?

1005
01:15:08,530 --> 01:15:10,830
He's much bigger than I am

1006
01:15:11,010 --> 01:15:13,200
and I'm the biggest
of all of us.

1007
01:15:14,170 --> 01:15:15,600
He's tall.

1008
01:15:15,770 --> 01:15:17,840
He's very muscular.

1009
01:15:18,370 --> 01:15:20,720
And he's got a long mane of hair

1010
01:15:20,810 --> 01:15:25,200
and his fingers are
twice the length of ours.

1011
01:15:26,170 --> 01:15:28,550
He believes
we are extraordinary.

1012
01:15:29,730 --> 01:15:34,200
That we don't represent a mistake,
but our potential.

1013
01:15:37,170 --> 01:15:39,040
You say the same things.

1014
01:15:41,610 --> 01:15:43,480
He's on the move.

1015
01:15:44,130 --> 01:15:45,760
What does that mean?

1016
01:15:46,810 --> 01:15:48,440
I don't understand.

1017
01:15:49,650 --> 01:15:51,440
He can't be real.

1018
01:15:52,970 --> 01:15:56,920
There must be limits to what
a human being can become.

1019
01:15:58,650 --> 01:16:00,040
And there's another whole part

1020
01:16:00,130 --> 01:16:01,840
of the story, isn't there?

1021
01:16:02,530 --> 01:16:05,560
About the eating
of the impure young?

1022
01:16:06,210 --> 01:16:08,670
What does impure even mean?

1023
01:16:09,010 --> 01:16:10,010
Well...

1024
01:16:10,090 --> 01:16:11,360
We should discuss that

1025
01:16:11,450 --> 01:16:13,440
so that you can
understand fully.

1026
01:16:13,610 --> 01:16:15,120
Understand what?

1027
01:16:15,290 --> 01:16:17,040
Sometimes,

1028
01:16:18,130 --> 01:16:20,280
there's just no other way.

1029
01:16:23,450 --> 01:16:25,720
Who are you going to meet?

1030
01:16:27,890 --> 01:16:29,240
Him.

1031
01:16:34,570 --> 01:16:35,570
You know what?

1032
01:16:35,730 --> 01:16:38,110
I would love to take notes
on all of this.

1033
01:16:39,050 --> 01:16:41,120
We should probably discuss this

1034
01:16:41,250 --> 01:16:42,800
in a proper session tomorrow.

1035
01:16:42,970 --> 01:16:44,280
Really?

1036
01:16:44,450 --> 01:16:45,960
You're okay with this?

1037
01:16:46,170 --> 01:16:49,790
This has been so wonderful,
you being so open.

1038
01:16:49,890 --> 01:16:52,160
I can see that
you feel very empowered

1039
01:16:52,250 --> 01:16:53,960
by the philosophies
of The Beast.

1040
01:16:54,130 --> 01:16:55,800
I'm going to go now.

1041
01:16:56,010 --> 01:16:58,600
I knew you would understand.
I'll see you.

1042
01:17:12,250 --> 01:17:14,080
Would you mind

1043
01:17:16,170 --> 01:17:18,440
if I used your bathroom?

1044
01:17:20,250 --> 01:17:21,280
No.

1045
01:17:22,810 --> 01:17:26,640
It's down the hall,
near the stairs, on your left.

1046
01:17:31,130 --> 01:17:32,480
How we doing?

1047
01:17:33,450 --> 01:17:34,640
I'm okay.

1048
01:18:14,490 --> 01:18:16,000
Are you real?

1049
01:18:19,810 --> 01:18:21,080
Who is it?

1050
01:18:21,490 --> 01:18:22,630
Help me.

1051
01:18:24,330 --> 01:18:25,330
Help me.

1052
01:18:25,490 --> 01:18:27,160
Is someone there?

1053
01:18:29,690 --> 01:18:31,520
Please help me.

1054
01:18:34,010 --> 01:18:36,160
They will never reach
their potential.

1055
01:18:36,330 --> 01:18:37,600
They don't really matter.

1056
01:18:37,770 --> 01:18:39,680
Listen to me, Dennis.

1057
01:18:40,330 --> 01:18:42,840
I should've listened better.

1058
01:18:43,010 --> 01:18:45,680
I should've understood
what you're capable of,

1059
01:18:45,850 --> 01:18:47,440
how powerful you are.

1060
01:18:47,930 --> 01:18:50,040
Patricia says your way
isn't working.

1061
01:18:50,250 --> 01:18:52,000
The world will understand now.

1062
01:18:52,410 --> 01:18:56,440
Dennis, this is
an egregious wrong.

1063
01:18:58,290 --> 01:19:00,120
These young women are suffering.

1064
01:19:00,290 --> 01:19:01,760
This is a crime.

1065
01:19:01,970 --> 01:19:04,080
I can't let you keep them here.

1066
01:19:04,250 --> 01:19:05,960
We've gotta stop this.

1067
01:19:06,130 --> 01:19:08,240
This identity is monstrous.

1068
01:19:08,410 --> 01:19:10,200
I'm really sad
you feel this way.

1069
01:19:10,370 --> 01:19:11,800
Can't you see?

1070
01:19:11,970 --> 01:19:14,960
He is formed because of
your time in this place.

1071
01:19:42,250 --> 01:19:43,720
There's a lady.

1072
01:19:44,650 --> 01:19:46,360
Someone's here.

1073
01:19:48,010 --> 01:19:50,080
We need to
get out of these rooms.

1074
01:19:52,410 --> 01:19:53,840
Is there anything in your room?

1075
01:19:53,930 --> 01:19:55,010
Anything that we could use?

1076
01:20:03,450 --> 01:20:05,240
There's nothing in here.

1077
01:20:07,770 --> 01:20:09,560
There's a hanger.

1078
01:20:33,370 --> 01:20:34,920
Thank you, Dennis.

1079
01:20:36,610 --> 01:20:37,960
Here you go, sir.

1080
01:20:56,290 --> 01:21:00,320
It sounded like there were slide
bolts on the outside of our doors.

1081
01:21:00,490 --> 01:21:03,160
See if you can move the lock
through the crack in the door.

1082
01:22:12,850 --> 01:22:14,280
Stay calm.

1083
01:22:14,450 --> 01:22:17,240
We're getting out of here.
We're gonna get Casey.

1084
01:22:18,650 --> 01:22:20,480
You can do this, Marcia.

1085
01:22:56,290 --> 01:22:57,920
With regard to
Chahamana's defeat

1086
01:22:58,010 --> 01:22:59,680
and Muhammad of Ghor's conquests

1087
01:22:59,850 --> 01:23:02,280
between 1192 and 1200,

1088
01:23:03,010 --> 01:23:06,680
I would liken it to
Muhammad's brazen ultimatum

1089
01:23:06,850 --> 01:23:10,120
that Prithviraj
either apostatize or fight.

1090
01:23:12,010 --> 01:23:14,800
Like Prithviraj's defiance,

1091
01:23:15,370 --> 01:23:18,160
we should stand up
to The Horde's advances.

1092
01:23:18,890 --> 01:23:22,400
In the face of their scare tactics,
we should show...

1093
01:23:23,970 --> 01:23:25,760
I hate my insulin shots.

1094
01:23:26,850 --> 01:23:28,880
No one else around here
has to take them.

1095
01:23:29,050 --> 01:23:31,080
Why do I have to have diabetes?

1096
01:23:32,250 --> 01:23:34,680
All the doctors,
besides Dr. Fletcher,

1097
01:23:34,770 --> 01:23:37,120
say that we're the same person.

1098
01:23:37,770 --> 01:23:39,800
Just personalities, huh?

1099
01:23:40,770 --> 01:23:42,130
How do you explain
I'm the only one

1100
01:23:42,210 --> 01:23:43,570
that needs these,
you motherfuck...

1101
01:23:49,050 --> 01:23:51,430
I'm wearing cargo pants
from the '90s.

1102
01:23:52,210 --> 01:23:54,200
And a scarf.

1103
01:23:54,370 --> 01:23:56,640
If it wasn't for the Varvatos
T-shirt underneath,

1104
01:23:56,730 --> 01:23:58,360
I'd be a mess.

1105
01:23:59,410 --> 01:24:01,360
I got no taste
for things right now.

1106
01:24:02,330 --> 01:24:05,720
I'm worried sick.

1107
01:24:06,930 --> 01:24:09,800
I have a very bad feeling
that I'm losing time.

1108
01:24:10,530 --> 01:24:12,040
I decide
who gets the light, right?

1109
01:24:12,210 --> 01:24:13,560
I think

1110
01:24:13,730 --> 01:24:17,080
someone is stealing the light
from me when I'm not aware.

1111
01:24:17,650 --> 01:24:21,800
The Horde keeps obsessing about
the ones who haven't suffered.

1112
01:24:21,970 --> 01:24:26,400
I don't know where they're going
with this, but it scares me.

1113
01:25:27,170 --> 01:25:29,800
Picture yourself
in a couple hours at home.

1114
01:25:30,570 --> 01:25:32,000
On the couch,

1115
01:25:33,090 --> 01:25:35,550
in that ugly-ass sweatshirt
that you love.

1116
01:25:46,450 --> 01:25:48,120
It's an animal!

1117
01:25:49,010 --> 01:25:51,800
He goes like this if there's
a coyote or something.

1118
01:27:32,010 --> 01:27:33,880
Kevin, Kevin.

1119
01:28:02,370 --> 01:28:04,200
Thank you

1120
01:28:05,490 --> 01:28:07,870
for helping us till now.

1121
01:29:14,050 --> 01:29:16,560
I guess I should tell
Dr. Fletcher about this,

1122
01:29:18,010 --> 01:29:19,480
but she'll worry.

1123
01:29:19,570 --> 01:29:21,080
She's such a sweet woman.

1124
01:29:22,930 --> 01:29:26,240
I believe I will go
for a nice walk

1125
01:29:26,970 --> 01:29:30,560
and think this
through organizationally.

1126
01:29:33,370 --> 01:29:37,680
Thus ends my journal for Monday.

1127
01:29:37,850 --> 01:29:38,850
Ciao.

1128
01:31:00,250 --> 01:31:01,360
Claire.

1129
01:31:04,330 --> 01:31:05,440
Marcia.

1130
01:31:28,170 --> 01:31:29,280
Claire.

1131
01:31:30,210 --> 01:31:31,480
Claire, let's go.

1132
01:32:43,490 --> 01:32:45,320
"Kevin Wendell Crumb."

1133
01:33:11,250 --> 01:33:13,160
Kevin Wendell Crumb?

1134
01:33:18,090 --> 01:33:19,150
Kevin Wendell Crumb.

1135
01:33:21,930 --> 01:33:24,680
Kevin Wendell Crumb!

1136
01:33:35,530 --> 01:33:37,440
Kevin Wendell Crumb.

1137
01:33:38,970 --> 01:33:41,430
Kevin Wendell Crumb.

1138
01:33:42,130 --> 01:33:44,000
You made a mess.

1139
01:33:45,090 --> 01:33:46,720
Come out here.

1140
01:33:49,050 --> 01:33:50,760
Kevin Wendell Crumb!

1141
01:33:50,930 --> 01:33:52,560
You made a mess!

1142
01:33:52,730 --> 01:33:53,950
Get out here!

1143
01:34:20,690 --> 01:34:22,440
Who are you?

1144
01:34:22,930 --> 01:34:24,640
What's happening?

1145
01:34:26,770 --> 01:34:28,360
Something horrible.

1146
01:34:30,330 --> 01:34:31,600
What'd I do?

1147
01:34:33,570 --> 01:34:35,280
Did I hurt you?

1148
01:34:43,370 --> 01:34:44,840
Dr. Fletcher.

1149
01:34:45,330 --> 01:34:46,960
Dr. Fletcher.

1150
01:34:48,930 --> 01:34:50,760
Who did that?

1151
01:34:52,650 --> 01:34:54,160
You did.

1152
01:34:54,530 --> 01:34:56,800
I swear, I was on a bus.

1153
01:34:57,490 --> 01:34:59,760
I don't remember
anything after that. I...

1154
01:35:01,450 --> 01:35:04,840
This is still
September 18, 2014, right?

1155
01:35:15,530 --> 01:35:17,360
There's a shotgun I bought.

1156
01:35:18,850 --> 01:35:21,440
It's in the bottom cabinet,
hidden behind things.

1157
01:35:21,610 --> 01:35:24,840
The shells are in my uniform
closet out in the service hall.

1158
01:35:27,770 --> 01:35:28,960
Kill me.

1159
01:35:32,650 --> 01:35:33,960
Then kill me.

1160
01:35:40,450 --> 01:35:41,450
Wait, no!

1161
01:35:41,530 --> 01:35:42,800
Don't do that!

1162
01:35:43,010 --> 01:35:44,640
He can't handle reality.

1163
01:35:45,170 --> 01:35:46,170
My name is Jade.

1164
01:35:46,210 --> 01:35:48,200
Has Dr. Fletcher been
getting our emails?

1165
01:35:48,370 --> 01:35:49,840
This is what we have to do.

1166
01:35:51,050 --> 01:35:52,880
As in 1008,

1167
01:35:53,050 --> 01:35:56,670
when Anandapala suffered the
Shahis' most crushing defeat

1168
01:35:56,850 --> 01:36:00,120
and Mahmud overran the
entirety of the Punjab region,

1169
01:36:00,290 --> 01:36:02,920
taking the famed temple
of Kangra,

1170
01:36:03,010 --> 01:36:05,960
we have been wronged
by this alliance,

1171
01:36:06,130 --> 01:36:09,040
this horde of Patricia,
Dennis and the boy.

1172
01:36:09,250 --> 01:36:12,240
Their actions
do not represent us.

1173
01:36:12,810 --> 01:36:14,160
They are every...

1174
01:36:14,570 --> 01:36:17,080
Everybody, just take a minute!

1175
01:36:17,650 --> 01:36:20,030
Oh, baby girl.

1176
01:36:20,210 --> 01:36:22,210
They've been stealing control
of the light from me.

1177
01:36:22,250 --> 01:36:24,810
But the group
are gonna work through this.

1178
01:36:25,010 --> 01:36:27,160
Honey, my name is Barry.

1179
01:36:37,010 --> 01:36:39,130
You shouldn't
have used the walkie-talkie.

1180
01:36:43,330 --> 01:36:45,000
They almost caught us.

1181
01:36:46,850 --> 01:36:48,160
Stop it, Hedwig!

1182
01:36:48,930 --> 01:36:51,600
They were right.
Look at you.

1183
01:36:52,090 --> 01:36:53,720
You're so frightened of us.

1184
01:36:55,090 --> 01:36:58,560
Dennis and Miss Patricia
are in charge because of me.

1185
01:36:59,250 --> 01:37:01,440
I'm gonna give the light
to them now.

1186
01:37:02,210 --> 01:37:06,120
No one's allowed to
make fun of me anymore.

1187
01:37:18,370 --> 01:37:20,720
Thank you, Hedwig.

1188
01:37:24,970 --> 01:37:26,640
Everything's fine now.

1189
01:37:26,810 --> 01:37:28,600
Kevin Wendell Crumb.

1190
01:37:30,810 --> 01:37:32,400
Kevin is asleep.

1191
01:37:32,570 --> 01:37:34,480
We've made him sleep far away.

1192
01:37:34,970 --> 01:37:37,240
You can call his name
all you like, dear,

1193
01:37:37,330 --> 01:37:39,400
but he's not going to hear you.

1194
01:37:40,450 --> 01:37:43,600
The Beast has
shared with us his dream

1195
01:37:43,690 --> 01:37:46,800
of a larger group
to sustain him.

1196
01:37:47,010 --> 01:37:48,280
No.

1197
01:37:48,450 --> 01:37:52,280
Ten to 12 unworthy young
next time.

1198
01:37:54,010 --> 01:37:56,440
This is just

1199
01:37:57,010 --> 01:37:58,400
the start.

1200
01:39:18,410 --> 01:39:19,440
Let go!

1201
01:39:54,570 --> 01:39:56,240
Help!

1202
01:39:58,130 --> 01:40:00,800
No! No!

1203
01:40:06,610 --> 01:40:07,750
No.

1204
01:40:19,250 --> 01:40:20,440
No.

1205
01:40:22,450 --> 01:40:24,600
It runs in our family.

1206
01:40:25,610 --> 01:40:27,800
My daddy died, too.

1207
01:40:27,970 --> 01:40:29,400
Same way.

1208
01:40:29,730 --> 01:40:31,280
Heart attack.

1209
01:40:33,810 --> 01:40:35,480
But you don't need to worry.

1210
01:40:35,570 --> 01:40:37,240
I'm going to take care of you.

1211
01:40:40,970 --> 01:40:42,080
Now,

1212
01:40:43,170 --> 01:40:46,000
you won't be giving me
any trouble, will you?

1213
01:40:46,850 --> 01:40:48,920
I know you won't, sweetie.

1214
01:41:10,050 --> 01:41:13,360
We are glorious!

1215
01:41:14,290 --> 01:41:17,520
We will no longer be afraid.

1216
01:41:27,250 --> 01:41:30,600
Only through pain

1217
01:41:31,890 --> 01:41:34,190
can you achieve your greatness!

1218
01:41:50,610 --> 01:41:54,600
The impure are the untouched,

1219
01:41:55,090 --> 01:41:58,760
the unburned, the unslain.

1220
01:42:01,570 --> 01:42:08,160
Those who have not been torn
have no value in themselves

1221
01:42:08,250 --> 01:42:12,280
and no place in this world!

1222
01:42:12,450 --> 01:42:15,960
They are asleep!

1223
01:42:35,130 --> 01:42:36,130
Fuck!

1224
01:42:37,210 --> 01:42:40,910
Your gun cannot hurt me.

1225
01:42:42,130 --> 01:42:45,480
Can't you see I am not human?

1226
01:42:47,690 --> 01:42:51,200
Kevin is a man.
I am much more.

1227
01:44:22,650 --> 01:44:26,520
You are different from the rest.

1228
01:44:36,690 --> 01:44:40,440
Your heart is pure!

1229
01:44:42,130 --> 01:44:44,400
Rejoice!

1230
01:44:50,130 --> 01:44:53,910
The broken are the more evolved.

1231
01:45:00,090 --> 01:45:02,760
Rejoice.

1232
01:46:03,330 --> 01:46:05,840
What in the name
of Mary and Joseph?

1233
01:46:07,090 --> 01:46:09,840
What are you doing in this area?

1234
01:46:50,570 --> 01:46:52,520
Just keep walking, honey.

1235
01:46:52,690 --> 01:46:54,240
They won't do nothing.

1236
01:47:30,290 --> 01:47:32,480
Vince, call the police.

1237
01:47:33,170 --> 01:47:36,320
She said some people got hurt
in the area below maintenance.

1238
01:47:57,490 --> 01:47:58,490
Okay.

1239
01:48:01,450 --> 01:48:03,520
Now, I'm just gonna check you.

1240
01:48:44,650 --> 01:48:47,240
Third deceased name of Dr.
Karen Fletcher.

1241
01:48:47,410 --> 01:48:49,790
Still trying to
locate the family.

1242
01:49:06,930 --> 01:49:09,040
Casey Cooke's guardian's here.

1243
01:49:19,530 --> 01:49:21,360
Your uncle's here.

1244
01:49:23,010 --> 01:49:24,760
You ready to go?

1245
01:50:14,050 --> 01:50:15,880
It didn't go through.

1246
01:50:20,970 --> 01:50:24,920
We are what we believe we are.

1247
01:50:30,450 --> 01:50:32,560
Holy shit!

1248
01:50:32,890 --> 01:50:35,480
This is so cool!

1249
01:50:38,770 --> 01:50:41,400
They're gonna believe
we exist now, right?

1250
01:50:44,210 --> 01:50:45,880
They're gonna have to.

1251
01:50:48,450 --> 01:50:50,480
So what do we do now?

1252
01:50:54,130 --> 01:50:55,600
We trust in him.

1253
01:50:58,250 --> 01:50:59,760
He'll protect us.

1254
01:51:01,290 --> 01:51:04,800
Look at what he can do.

1255
01:51:06,650 --> 01:51:10,400
Let him show the world
how powerful we can be.

1256
01:51:19,970 --> 01:51:22,270
The suspected
murderer Kevin Crumb

1257
01:51:22,490 --> 01:51:26,480
suffers from the controversial
psychological disorder DID.

1258
01:51:26,650 --> 01:51:29,840
The rumors coming out of the
scene are almost unbelievable.

1259
01:51:30,010 --> 01:51:33,840
There are conflicting stories
if the suspect is alive or dead

1260
01:51:34,010 --> 01:51:36,520
after sustaining
two point-blank gunshots.

1261
01:51:36,690 --> 01:51:39,480
Reports even indicate
one of his personalities

1262
01:51:39,650 --> 01:51:41,800
is an amalgam of
the various animals

1263
01:51:41,930 --> 01:51:44,000
in the Philadelphia Zoo
where he worked.

1264
01:51:44,170 --> 01:51:47,000
The press is already referring
to the alleged attacker

1265
01:51:47,170 --> 01:51:50,790
by a dark name leaked by
a source close to the case.

1266
01:51:50,970 --> 01:51:54,120
Because of his many personalities,
he is being called

1267
01:51:54,210 --> 01:51:55,270
The Horde.

1268
01:51:56,810 --> 01:51:58,880
This is like that crazy
guy in the wheelchair

1269
01:51:58,970 --> 01:52:01,000
that they put away 15 years ago.

1270
01:52:01,730 --> 01:52:04,190
And they gave him
a funny name, too.

1271
01:52:05,130 --> 01:52:06,680
What was it?

1272
01:52:07,370 --> 01:52:08,640
Mr. Glass.

1273
01:52:08,810 --> 01:52:09,950
Oh, yeah.
